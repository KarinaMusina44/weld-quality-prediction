### ```2025-10-15``` â€” Kick-off Meeting 
- Created the Git repository and discussed project organization.
- Decided that each member will explore the dataset individually (preprocessing + PCA) on their own branch, to become familiar with the data and the problem.
- Next meeting scheduled in one week ```2025-10-22```: 
    - Share results and decide which ML approaches to try.
    - Merge the preprocessing versions (final merging strategy to be decided next week).
    - Assign ML methods to each member.
    - Define the testing pipeline and evaluation metrics.
